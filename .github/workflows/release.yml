# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel.

  # This workflow contains a single job called "build_and_release".

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job.

      # Step 1: Check out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
